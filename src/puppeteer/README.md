# Puppeteer
This is basic example for mocha + puppeteer.

## Commands

- `npm start` - Start a static server using [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve). Run `npm start` and go to `http://localhost:5000` to see the index page in action.
- `npm test` - Run mocha tests. By default, runs Puppeteer in headless mode. Use `env D=1 npm test` to turn off headless mode so you can watch Mocha click through the app.
